This is my individual project for RMU.

HOW TO SET UP:
This is tested on Rails 3 on MRI Ruby 1.8.7.

The site is currently live at http://minivid.heroku.com but you can use this yourself.

- Clone the repository
- Bundle install
- Migrate DB

That should be it!

WHAT IS DONE SO FAR:
In the September session, I've learned a lot from this project:
It's my first Rails 3 project, as well as my first experience with Cucumber, Capybara, and BDD in general.

The app takes user-uploaded files, tweaks them to truncate at 1 minute using ffmpeg, and uses the pandastream service to encode and put them on my Amazon S3 cloud storage.

It's very basic, but it gets the job done.

WHAT ISN'T DONE:
I didn't get to implement video tagging, or advanced sharing through sites like Twitter.

The 10-megabyte upload limit is a result of using limited free developer tools, and doesn't allow for any display of errors, so if a user tries to upload anything larger, the app just appears to hang.

The validations don't seem to be working correctly, possibly as a result of this Pandastream "hanging" that happens on upload.

There's no design yet. Just uploading and viewing videos.

I haven't yet set up graceful degradation from HTML5 to Flash. It's all HTML5 now, and it may stay that way.
